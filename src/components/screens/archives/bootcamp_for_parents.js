          COVID-19 presents as either a mild flu-like condition (asymptomatic or
          mild symptoms) or more serious illness in those at high risk. A very
          small fraction of persons infected with the COVID-19-causing virus,
          progress to serious illness (increased age, obesity, renal disease,
          cardiovascular disease, COPD etc. are typical risk factors). Evidence
          indicates that younger persons manifest similar risk factors whereby{" "}

          In terms of risk of COVID to children, the vast evidence over one year
          now shows that children are at a vanishingly low risk of serious
          illness from COVID. This evidence is settled. As to a vaccine for the
          children, the fact is that if children are at such low, near zero risk
          of being infected or of becoming seriously ill, then no child should
          be in receipt of these vaccines. There is no basis for&nbsp;

          What is the rationale for this push to vaccinate children and what is
          the basis? Why would there be a push to vaccinate six-month-old
          babies? Vaccinate two-year-old infants? Vaccinate six-year-old
          children? Ten-year-old children? Via an experimental vaccine that

          &nbsp;Covid-19 to others readily, either to other children, other

          demonstrated elegantly in a study performed in the&nbsp;

          </a>
          &nbsp;literature is settled science on this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is there an absence of evidence supporting the notion that
          children spread Covid-19 virus in any meaningful way, but there is
          direct evidence showing that they simply do&nbsp;<em>not</em>
          &nbsp;spread this disease! This has been shown in&nbsp;
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32489179/">
            school settings
          </a>
          &nbsp;and as published&nbsp;
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914746/">
            in other papers
          </a>
          . Children typically, if infected, have asymptomatic illness. It is
          well-noted that asymptomatic cases are not the drivers of the
          pandemic; something particularly important in relation to children as
          they’re generally asymptomatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this regard it is evident that neither children (nor asymptomatic
          adults) are the key&nbsp;
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32430964/">drivers</a>
          &nbsp;of SARS-CoV-2. In the rare cases where a child is infected with
          SARS-CoV-2, it is exceptionally rare for the child to get severely ill
          or die. And to reiterate,&nbsp;

          &nbsp;literature suggests that this is now settled science. Yet it
          seems that the ‘television’ medical experts and prominent US agency
          representatives, as well as government advisors and bureaucrats either
          do not read the science, do not understand the science, do not ‘get’
          it, are blinded to it, or are just ignorant to the data and science.
          Most of what we have just stated we have known for one year now. This
          is not ‘new’ evidence, this has been settled for one year now, and
          certainly since last fall 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          We even know of the early ‘potent’ seminal study calling into question
          ‘asymptomatic’ spread in Covid-19 which was published in&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">
            <em>Nature</em>
          </a>
          &nbsp;and was not covered by the media or television medical experts,
          and which showed that in a sample of ten million, when all positive
          ‘asymptomatic’ cases were followed and all close contacts were traced
          (n=1,174), there were zero (0) no instances of asymptomatic spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us briefly look at the high-quality robust study in the&nbsp;
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32277759/">French Alps</a>
          &nbsp;examining the spread of Covid-19 virus via a cluster of
          Covid-19. They followed one infected child who visited three different
          schools and interacted with other children, teachers, and various
          adults. They reported no instance of secondary transmission despite
          close interactions.&nbsp;These data have been available to the CDC and
          other health experts for over a year.&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7821981/">
            Ludvigsson
          </a>

          <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;on Covid-19 among
          children 1 to 16 years of age and their teachers in Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, from the nearly 2 million children that were followed in
          school in Sweden, it was reported that with no mask mandates, there
          were zero deaths from Covid and a few instances of transmission and
          minimal hospitalization. A study published in<em>&nbsp;</em>
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">

          </a>
          &nbsp;found no instances of asymptomatic spread from positive
          asymptomatic cases among all 1,174 close contacts of the cases, based
          on a base sample of 10 million persons. The&nbsp;

          &nbsp;(WHO) also made this claim that asymptomatic spread/transmission
          is rare. This issue of asymptomatic spread is the key issue being used
          to force vaccination in children.&nbsp;The science, however, remains
          contrary to this proposed policy mandate.

          Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis
          (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) are&nbsp;serious
          health issues and have emerged in persons vaccinated, especially teen
          boys. This should be a caution to parents with regards to children and
          we are calling for no COVID vaccination for our children. There is no

          148 cases of myocarditis were reported within 30 days of immunisation,

          In closing, our children are not ‘tiny adults’ and their physiological

          vaccine is safe for kids, the issue is there is no basis for it, none!
          The CDC and experts like Dr. Fauci have been wrong on lockdowns, on
          school closures, and on mask mandates. Just plain wrong! They have all
          created an utter mess for our societies as we begin emerging from the
          pain of the punitive unsound lockdowns and school closures. Parents
          must now step up and demand that Dr. Fauci, CDC, NIH, and Moderna and
          other vaccine developers (and any entity with interests in the
          development of these vaccines) make their case for vaccinating their
          children. Do not simply accept this for there is no credible reason
          for it. We ask you as parents to adopt the words ‘risk-management’ and
          ‘cost-benefit’ as your guiding principles now on all things Covid-19,
          especially for your children’s sake. You have to assess the facts and
          demand these from them. You must&nbsp;

          this responsibility for the implications are way too great to do
          otherwise. Do not let our governments and media medical experts put a

          from pushing back and asking needed questions.

        <p>
          Vaccinating our children with a possibly harmful (untested) vaccine to
          them and with no basis given their risk profile, must be pushed back
          upon hard by parents. Like these mentioned contrarians and skeptics
          who have raised the ‘inconvenient truths’ surrounding Covid-19
          responding, parents now have a very equal, sensitized, focused, and
          critical role in raising the right questions and taking a stand.
          Parents are the voices of their children now on vaccinating their
          children and on the other looming disaster, Covid-19 ‘vaccine
          passports,’ that are as illogical and dangerous as vaccines for
          children under 12! Americans must stand up now to this!

        <p>
          We end by saying, we should think twice, then think twice again, and
          then even think again one more time, before vaccinating kids against
          Covid-19. The data or evidence or science is not there to support
