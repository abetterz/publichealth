            <p>
              During the past 19 months, the global spread of the Severe Acute
              Respiratory Syndrome, Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has
              led to acute hospitalizations and death in primarily high-risk
              elderly and younger age groups who often present with serious
              comorbidities associated with increased risk.&nbsp; Otherwise, the
              virus is largely self-limiting and of little clinical consequence
              in those infected outside of high-risk groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              SARS-CoV-2 (80% similar genetic composition as the SARS-CoV-1
              virus that emerged in 2003 (SARS) in China) is the virus that
              causes the illness we know as COVID-19. Think of this in the same
              manner as we look at HIV/AIDS (though two entirely different
              viruses). HIV is the virus that causes the subsequent AIDS-like
              syndrome of illnesses (typically end-stage illness). One can be
              infected and not go onto clinical disease. This is similar also in
              TB infection versus active tuberculosis disease and the key point
              being that most persons, 99% who are infected do not have any
              problems with COVID virus/illness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reader should understand that COVID-19 is not a viral
              pneumonia. The medical community operated in this manner but
              emerging evidence revealed that it is rather a viral vascular
              endotheliitis and it attacks the lining of blood vessels (vascular
              lining/endothelial cells), particularly the endothelial lining of
              the small pulmonary alveolar capillaries, leading to endothelial
              cell activation and sloughing, coagulopathy, sepsis, pulmonary
              edema, and ARDS-like symptoms. Thus COVID-19 is a disease of the
              blood and blood vessels, of the vasculature and must be treated as
              such. Failure to address advanced COVID-19 disease in this way
              will lead to severe illness and/or death. As a disease of the
              circulatory system, any pneumonia (florid pneumonia) that emerges,
              is secondary to that.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a person dies of end-stage COVID-19 and they have difficulty
              breathing etc., it is not because there is virus in the lungs, but
              rather there are massive amounts of micro-thrombi (blood clots) in
              the lungs that impede the gas exchange with edema etc. As such
              physicians etc. must aggressively address the blood clots with
              high-dose aspirin, heparin etc. and recognize that the patient has
              massive clots in the vasculature (often in the pulmonary capillary
              vasculature) as they wrestle with the breathing challenge. When
              COVID-19 is severe, this can lead to sepsis, blood clots, and
              catastrophic multiple organ failure, including hypoxic and
              inflammatory damage to various vital organs, such as the brain,
              heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and intestines. The result is
              that the organs shut down as death nears.
            </p>
            <p>
              The progression from the initial viral replication stage (spanning
              approximately two weeks from infection/initial symptom onset) to
              the subsequent hyperimmune, inflammatory, ARDS, florid pneumonia
              ‘cytokine storm’ stage (that occurs around seven/eight days to 14
              days from symptom onset) presents a clear window of opportunity to
              arrest the disease progression and prevent hospitalization (and
              potential death). The initial two weeks are absolutely critical
              (and particularly the hyperinflammatory stage by day 8
              <sup>th</sup> or so from symptom onset) if we can get in there
              clinically and provide early treatment (which we will highlight
              briefly below).
            </p>
            <p>
              Common laboratory findings in COVID-19 disease are elevated
              D-dimer, elevated prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein,
              neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, and hyperferritinemia,
              essentially matching a profile of coagulopathy and immune system
              hyperactivation/immune cell exhaustion.
            </p>
            <p>
              COVID-19 can attack a broad array of the body’s vital organs and
              as such presents with many illnesses, though the most common
              initial illness presentation is respiratory illness and flu-like
              symptoms. However, it can present as brain inflammation,
              gastrointestinal disease, or even heart attack or pulmonary
              embolism.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that the vast amount of people who confront
              COVID-19 virus or illness will have no severe problem with it and
              will be fine, while a small number of persons do need aggressive
              clinical support. This is correct, near all persons who get
              infected recover fully and do not go onto severe illness. Children
              have a near zero (statistical zero) risk of readily acquiring
              infection, are at low risk of&nbsp;

              What does the evidence show about the actual risk of COVID and as
              it pertains to children? The infection mortality rate (IFR) is
              roughly similar (or likely lower once all infection data are
              collected) to seasonal influenza. Stanford’s&nbsp;

              and concluded that among people &lt;70 years old across the world,
              infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.57% with a median

            <p>
              However, as mentioned, a small number may get more serious illness
              and this is due to underlying risk factors, principle among them
              being advanced age (especially if the person has underlying
              medical conditions) and obesity. We cannot discount that COVID is
              serious. It is very dangerous for elderly persons with underlying
              medical conditions and has shown us how potent it can be to this
              group. Thus COVID-19 exploits risk factors and is more severe in
              those with specific comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, and
              hypertension. These conditions tend to involve endothelial
              dysfunction, which leaves the circulatory system more susceptible
              to infection and injury by this SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            </p>

              The global data is unequivocal that “deaths from COVID are{" "}

              these children died ‘with’ COVID or ‘of’ COVID. Put another way,
              no convincing information has been given by the CDC to determine
              if these were causal or incidental COVID deaths. Dr. Marty Makary

              vaccination of children against COVID-19.

            <p>
              As mentioned, the overwhelming majority of infections are mild and
              do not cause significant disease. In fact, most often, persons do
              not know they are infected and there is typically an 85/15% rule
              where 85% or so of infections are mild (asymptomatic) and 15% or
              so are more challenging (may require support and even
              hospitalization/ICU care). Most experience mild or no symptoms at
              all. Yet remember, it is more severe in persons with underlying
              conditions and risk factors such as age, obesity etc. The virus
              can spread rapidly. Presently, the global community is confronting
              a predominant Delta variant of the virus, distinct from the
              initial variants, highly contagious and less virulent. The concept
              of ‘<em>Muller’s ratchet</em>’ may help explain (at least
              partially) the development of various variants/mutations including
              that of the&nbsp;SARS-CoV-2&nbsp;Delta variant which, as per
              Muller’s concept, is generally more contagious but less deadly
              than the original version of SARS-CoV-2 that originated from
              Wuhan. This is typically how viruses behave across time, whereby
              they evolve to more non-lethal versions so that they do not kill
              the host, while becoming more transmissible so that they, the
              virus, can survive into the future. The Delta variant poses even
              less risk to the health of our children than previous iterations
              of this virus. There are some however, who speculate that the
              Delta variant may be more pathological than initial variants.
              Although all the data we have seen thus far suggests otherwise, we
              must remain open to the possibility and be alert to this should
              future evidence show this. At this time, it does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is the good news as seen in data out of Israel and UK. The
              challenge however has been persons who are becoming infected with
              Delta who were double-vaccinated (breakthrough infections when the
              vaccine is sub-optimal and failing as the Wuhan 2020 strain is
              long gone and we are confronted with the Delta variant and thus
              the antibodies cannot stop the Delta variant/spike protein), are
              showing more severe illness needing hospitalization as well as are
              dying.
            </p>
            <p>
              When someone has end-stage COVID-19 disease with sepsis (blood
              infection), hypoxia (breathing difficulty), and coagulopathy
              (blood clots) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
              florid pneumonia, they are typically taken into the ICU and
              intubated and administered corticosteroids. Often anti-clotting
              drugs are given. Some aggressively argue that this is not correct
              and can kill the patient since when someone is severely hypoxic,
              large amounts of oxygen can be counter-productive with free
              radicals damaging the tissues. “This is called{" "}
              <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29694958/">
                ischemia-reperfusion injury
              </a>
              , and it’s why the majority of people who go on a ventilator are
              dying. In the mitochondria, succinate buildup due to sepsis does
              the same exact thing; when oxygen is reintroduced, it makes
              superoxide radicals”. The medical community has pivoted away from
              aggressive ventilation given accumulated evidence that it caused
              deaths, especially when implemented properly. Evidence suggests
              that COVID-19’s severe pathology is dominated by “extreme
              oxidative stress and neutrophil respiratory burst, to the point
              where hemoglobin becomes incapable of carrying oxygen due to heme
              iron being stripped out of heme by hypochlorous acid.{" "}

              COVID-19 is airborne and spread by droplet and aerosolized means.
              Not only spread via droplet infection. There is even an oro-fecal
              component that has been largely disregarded yet likely plays a
              more potent role. Fomite-to-face is not a primary mode of spread.
              The 6-foot social distance rules are useless and some high placed
              US officials even admit that in the US this distance was ‘made
              up’. One would need at least 12 to 15 to 20 feet of distance to
              guard from aerosolized transmission. Similarly, the blue surgical
              masks and white cloth masks are useless against protecting against
              aerosolized transmission (a one micron virus facing at least 3
              micron filters and thus ease of passage). An examination of the
              evidence suggests that the masks are ineffective.

              combined with pleiotropic drugs including doxycycline and

              A more viable and effective treatment option in the form of SMDT
              which is highly safe and effective for the prevention and
              treatment of COVID-19.&nbsp; As noted above, healthy children and
              young adults have little to no risk (statistical zero, almost
              zero) for death from COVID-19. &nbsp;If they do develop COVID-19,
              the presentation is usually mild. Although more severe disease can
              develop, especially in those with comorbidities, the treatments
              proposed hereunder (i.e., SMDT) should reduce the risk for serious
              disease and death by potentially the same 80-90% as seen in
              adults, if not more.

              life-threatening COVID-19 including viral-mediated organ damage,

              that clinicians must be aware of and treat accordingly in terms of
              timing of therapeutics in order to obtain optimal clinical
              outcomes. While this figure demonstrates the general
              pathophysiological course of COVID-19 in adults, it is highly
              relevant for high-risk children as well.

            <p>The illness can be divided into three phases:</p>
            <p>
              1) An initial viral replication phase whereby the virus{" "}
              <em>hijacks </em>the metabolic machinery of the host cells which
              then begin to synthesize new viral particles,
            </p>
            <p>
              2) A more advanced inflammatory hyper-dysregulated
              immune-modulatory florid pneumonia phase (acute inflammatory
              response) characterized by the cytokine storm and impaired gas
              exchange with breathing problems, this being representative of or
              at the least highly similar to ARDS, and which is generally what
              causes most deaths attributed to COVID-19, and
            </p>
            <p>
              3) A thromboembolic ‘blood-clotting’ phase whereby microthrombi
              develop within the lungs (causing hypoxemia) and in the
              vasculature,<sup>2</sup> leading to disastrous tertiary
              complications including cerebrovascular and myocardial ischemia,
              although notably, such infarcts can occur in any organ or tissue,
              causing unique symptoms relevant to the function of the organ or
              tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
              An ideal ‘early treatment’ regimen in adults will arrest the virus
              in the initial phase (during the days immediately post-infection
              when symptoms initially emerge) while the patient is still within
              the private home setting or extended care setting (nursing home,
              long-term care facility, assisted-living facility, care-home
              etc.). The goal is to prevent hospitalization and death. The risk
              of death escalates rapidly with time elapsed following the
              development of symptoms (the risk of death is approximately 38 to
              40% at 28 days in-hospital); hence the need for early intervention
              is critically important. The progression in high-risk children is
              likely comparable if they are not treated early based on
              extrapolation of clinical data.&nbsp; Figure 2 presented with
              permission and with updates by Dr. Peter McCullough (August 27
              <sup>th</sup> 2021), outlines early repurposed treatment (for
              early COVID-19 infection) for the adult population but can be
              adopted easily for high-risk children, adjusted by the treating
              physician.

              Fortunately, prompt and early initiation of SMDT remains a widely
              and currently available solution to stem the tide of
              hospitalizations and death. The repurposed drugs already have
              regulatory approval, are safe, effective, accessible, and
              economical.&nbsp; Physicians globally must embrace both the
              science and the art of medicine when they consider the needs of
              each of their patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no reason for physicians globally not to stand against
              these sanction threats and to exercise their best clinical
              judgement to save their patients.

            <p>
              As is seen in the protocols illustrated above, the multipronged
              ‘combination’ therapeutic approach, SMDT, includes

              2) Combination intracellular anti-infective therapy (antivirals
              and antibiotics, the latter having pleiotropic and beneficial
              effects on downregulation of viral replication, protease activity
              and oxidative stress which are critical components of ARDS);
            </p>

            <p>4) Antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants; and</p>
            <p>
              5) Supportive care including supplemental oxygen, and monitoring
              often requiring only telemedicine.

              In terms of the vaccine, the developed vaccines by Pfizer, Moderna
              etc. are non-sterilizing which means they do not produce the type
              of neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection, transmission,
              hospitalization, severe illness, or death. These vaccines were
              designed only to reduce mild symptoms of COVID-19. The vaccines
              are thus ‘leaky’ and allow for the generation of variants that
              could be far more lethal to the unvaccinated. Also, the nightmare
              of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) drives the enhanced
              infection and replication facilitated by the antibodies in the
              vaccinated. These vaccines remove the evolutionary pressure on the
              virus that would usually drive it to less lethality. Those
              vaccinated can become infected, carry it, and spread it to the
              unvaccinated (and vaccinated). This is a pandemic of the
              vaccinated, not the unvaccinated. Alarmingly, we have strong
              evidence that the spike protein that is being produced by the
              cells in a vaccinated person, is highly pathogenic and devastating
              to the vascular lining (endothelial layer) of blood vessels
              (arteries, veins, capillaries). “Those who have been immunized
              with COVID-19 vaccines have developed blood clots, myocarditis,{" "}

              , and multiple sclerosis flares, indicating that the vaccine
              promotes autoimmune reactions against healthy tissue”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bottom line is that these COVID vaccines were not developed
              optimally and are actually showing serious adverse effects and
              deaths 2 to 5 days post vaccine. These are dangerous and one can
              argue if one is fully informed and they decide to take the
              vaccine, then this is their decision. But one cannot be fully
              informed as the data, especially the safety data is not yet
              available and will not be as the studies ended when the
              placebo-controlled group were offered vaccine. The ability to
              declare effectiveness and safety is now moot and the vaccine
              developers, the CDC, NIH and all involved know that they are
              deceiving the nation.
